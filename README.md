# Trust-Aware-Health-Insights-from-Wearable-Data
## Project Overview

Consumer health platforms increasingly rely on wearable data to generate insights that influence user behavior. While these systems provide valuable feedback, misinterpretation of data can lead to unnecessary anxiety, false confidence, or poor decisions.

This project explores how wearable health data should be interpreted, contextualized, and communicated responsibly, using publicly available fitness tracker data as a case study.

## 🎯 Objectives

Analyze wearable health data to understand variability and noise

Identify scenarios where raw metrics may be misleading

Examine the limits of automated health insights

Propose safer, trust-aware interpretations for consumer health products

## 📊 Dataset

Source: Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (Kaggle)

Type: Time-series wearable data

Features Used:

Daily steps

Activity minutes

Calories burned

Sleep duration (optional)

This dataset represents non-clinical, consumer-grade health data and is suitable for studying interpretation risk rather than medical diagnosis.
